# Analysis-of-discharge-summaries-in-cardiac-cases
step-1: Data Collection
 The raw data we had obtained in the CSV format.
 The CSV sheet had 20 different columns and 350 rows ( data ).
 The data mainly consisted of information of Discharge summary of patients.

step-2:Data Cleaning
 The data had some of the confidential information such as IP Number, Hospital
Number, Laboratory data, Doctor Information, Contact numbers.
 Such kind of information are removed from the data set as the part of data cleaning.
 The columns such as Symptoms, Diagnosis, Procedures had a lot of characters which
was not required in order to get the key word from those columns we have used SPLIT 
function and obtained the key word which we require to visualize easily as a part of
data cleaning

step-3:Data visualization
1.Number of males and females
Here we have plotted the graph where x axis represent the gender of the patients and
y axis represent the number in each group.
So, it clearly represents that number of males are suffering from cardiac arrest.

2.Condition of patients
Here we have plotted the graph where x axis represent the condition of the patients
and y axis represent the number in each group.
So, it clearly represents that number of STABLE are more in number.

3.Days required to recover
Here we have plotted the graph where x axis represents number of days required for
discharge of the patients and y axis represent the number in each group.
So, it clearly represents that early identification of the condition decreases the
number of days for recovery.

4.Comparison of age group
Here we have plotted the graph where x axis represent the Age group of the patients
and y axis represent the number in each group and we have compared the male
against the female age group.
So, it clearly represents that number of males in any age group are more affected
than females, and also between the age group 40-80Y more number are affected by
cardiac problems.

5.symptoms
Here we have plotted the graph where x axis represents Symptoms of the patients
and y axis represent the total numbers.
So, it clearly represents that Chest pain is the most common symptom identified in
any cardiac case.

6.Investigation procedures
Here we have plotted the graph where x axis represents Investigation procedure of
the patients and y axis represent the total numbers.
So, it clearly represents that ECG is the most common Investigation procedure for
any cardiac case.


7.Final diagnosis
Here we have plotted the graph where x axis represents Final Diagnosis of the
patients and y axis represent the total numbers.

final outcome of this project is When a new patient arrives with certain symptoms we can find the procedures to
investigate and diagnosis.
